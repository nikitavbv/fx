# todo

- storage needs to be explicitly attached to each service, should not be a property of cloud
- logs/fetch should be explicitly allowed
- rpc should be explicitly allowed with a list of service/functions that services are allowed to call
- native sql support, like how currently kv is supported
- build something more complicated for a demo?
- cache compiled services/pre-compile to reduce cold start times
- router service
- cloud ui service
- blackbox tests for services
- handle errors everywhere
